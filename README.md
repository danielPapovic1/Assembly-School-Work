# Assembly and Parsing in Java Repository

## Purpose

### Assembly Work
The core of this repository is dedicated to learning x86 assembly using MASM. Programs here, primarily in the `main` branch, cover:

- Foundational concepts like:
  * Stack operations
  * Array handling
  * Matrix array initialization
  * Algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort)

**Key Library:** Leverages the Irvine32 library for input/output operations.

### Java Parsing
Separate branches, such as `Parsing`, focus on Java-based parsing techniques from related coursework:

- Includes exercises and projects involving:
  * String manipulation
  * Syntax analysis
  * Advanced parsing techniques

## Branches
- `main`: x86 Assembly programming
- `COMPILER-COURSE`: Java-based parsing projects
